### NPCGroups Makes Spawning NPCs in Garry's Mod Easier

NPCGroups is an addon for Garry's Mod originally created by NeoTanks and completely re-written and maintained by Jesse 'V92' Vanover.

NPCG allows for the spawning of NPCs in groups as well as making the NPCs in these groups smarter and customizable in effectiveness.

NPCGroups supplies many console variables that allow nearly every facet of the control be changed.
